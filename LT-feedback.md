### ***Lightning Talk Feedback***

***Project 1: The Flow of Energy***  
A very well-posed, straight forward project. If you can get all the data, and can work with it, this is a great one to choose. You definitely want to sure you have a lot of examples and that you have enough examples of tenants that did upgrade and tenants that did not!


***Project 2: We the People***  
This is a big project. It will be fairly challenging to get enough well-structured data to build a model on. If you want to pursue it, you will definitely have to narrow the scope and more explicitly define both the question you want to answer, and the outcome you are looking for. How do you *measure* the outcome here?


***Project 3: The Big Winner***  
This is great. We won't quite cover the type of model I think you would like to use to solve this problem. The only way I could actually think of doing this is to build a model that would try to mirror the sequencing of the numbers that come up. Otherwise, you are kind of just inferring numbers from numbers, but they don't have connective tissue between them (and your model would basically just show thats what you did hah). Not sure if this is very attainable.

Definitely check out Kaggle below!:
*As I mentioned before, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find some fall back datasets. Any dataset is fine, as long as it is well-structured. If things become a bit too difficult, it's very important to have a fallback you can rely on!*
