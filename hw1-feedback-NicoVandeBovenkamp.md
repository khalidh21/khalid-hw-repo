**Overall:** Good work on this first homework! Your answers are very explicit, concise, and well worded. You definitely grasp the concepts and research them really well!

**Some Notes**

* *Q.1* I am sure you are seeing this as you read that DS for Business Book, but Data Exploration is a bit more than distortions or missing values and outliers. It's much more about finding out what the data looks like, feels like, and what it has, or does not have.
* ***Q.2b and Plotting:*** You could use a scatter plot, but it wouldn't give you much information on the distribution. What you could plot is a histogram or similar plot. Also, plotting tip for next homework: try using [Seaborn](https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial). It's a good bit easier to use than matplotlib, and it has some very handy built-in methods!


**Something to think about**

We touch on this a bit in class, but think about how you can apply statistical tests to your data. There are many handy tests to determine difference of means (very useful), tests to determine assumptions of an underlying distribution, etc. For example, there are specific tests which will estimate how close a given distribution is to a normal distribution.
